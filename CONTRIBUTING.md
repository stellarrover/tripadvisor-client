## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and formatting
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Type Definitions

- All API types should be defined in the `src/types/` directory
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Export types from `src/types/index.ts`
- Keep types organized by domain (search, details, reviews, etc.)

### Error Handling

- Use custom error classes from `src/errors.ts`
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include error codes when applicable
- Handle both API errors and validation errors

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test both success and error cases

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test:watch
```

### Test Structure

- Unit tests should be in `src/*.test.ts` files
- Integration tests should be in `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names and organize with `describe` blocks
- Mock external dependencies to avoid API calls during testing

### Test Coverage

We aim for at least 80% test coverage. Coverage reports are generated automatically and can be viewed in the `coverage/` directory.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and clone your fork
2. **Create Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or fix
4. **Add Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
5. **Update Documentation**: Update README, CHANGELOG, and other docs as needed
6. **Run Checks**: Ensure all checks pass: `pnpm run check-all`
7. **Commit**: Use conventional commit format
8. **Push**: Push your changes to your fork
9. **Create PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of changes
- Include any breaking changes or new features
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Request reviews from maintainers

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix

## Release Process

### Versioning

We use semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (0.x.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Steps

1. **Update Version**: Update version in `package.json`
2. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. **Create Tag**: Create a git tag for the release
4. **Publish**: Publish to npm (handled by CI/CD)

### Pre-release

For pre-releases, use version tags:

```bash
# Alpha release
npm version prerelease --preid=alpha

# Beta release
npm version prerelease --preid=beta

# Release candidate
npm version prerelease --preid=rc
```
